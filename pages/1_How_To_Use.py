  #### ðŸ§¹ Step 1: Data Cleaning
  1. **Select a Dataset**: From the 'Data Cleaning' section, choose a dataset from the dropdown menu.
  2. **Inspect Data**: Examine the dataset for missing values or inconsistencies.
  3. **Handle Missing Values**: Opt to remove or impute missing data using various strategies.
  4. **Drop Columns**: Eliminate irrelevant features by dropping columns.
  5. **Scale Data**: Standardize or normalize your data if necessary for your model.

  #### ðŸ¤– Step 2: Model Training
  1. **Choose a Model**: In the 'Model Training' section, pick a machine learning model from the list.
  2. **Configure Split**: Decide the train-test split ratio for your data.
  3. **Train Model**: Hit the 'Train' button to start training your model on the preprocessed data.
  4. **Monitor Progress**: Keep an eye on the training progress through the interface.
  5. **Run Multiple Models**: Compare different models by training them one after the other.

  #### ðŸ“Š Step 3: Dashboard Metrics
  1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: After training, switch over to the 'Dashboard' to view metrics.
  2. **Select Dataset**: Compare different models by selecting them in the dashboard for any dataset.
  3. **Review Metrics**: Analyze accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and more.
  4. **Utilize Visualization**: Employ the integrated visualization tools for deeper insight.

  #### ðŸŽ¨ Step 4: Data Visualization
  1. **Open Visualization Section**: Explore further with the 'Data Visualization' section.
  2. **Create Plots**: Generate histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more to understand your data.
  3. **Interactive Exploration**: Dive deeper into the plots with interactive features.

  #### ðŸ’¡ Tips for Effective Use
  - **Save Your Work**: While the app doesn't save your session, you can download your results.
              Working to integerate with a cloud storage service for saving your work.
  - **Experiment Freely**: Test various preprocessing and model training options.
  - **Provide Feedback**: Use the in-app form to send feedback or report issues (Coming Soon).
